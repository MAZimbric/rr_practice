# How to fold a paper airplane

1. Take a sheet of standard printer paper and fold it in half on the longer axis. Sharply crease the paper and unfold.
2. Fold one corner of the paper down so that the shorter edge lies along the crease created in step 1. Sharply crease the fold.
3. Fold the other corner on the same short side of the page similarly, so that the two corners meet on the central crease line and sharply crease the fold.
4. Fold the page so that the crease created in step 2 lies along the crease created in step 1. Sharply crease the fold. 
5. Fold the page so that the crease created in step 3 lies along the crease created in step 1. Sharply crease the fold. 
6. Fold in half along the crease line created in step 1. You will have two flaps, one on either side of the crease you just made.
7. Fold one of the flaps down, making a fold parallel to the central fold created in step 6 but one inch away. Sharply crease the fold.
8. Fold the other flap the same way as in step 7 and sharply crease.
9. Pinching only the central crease created in step 6, partly unfold the folds made in steps 7 and 8 so that the flaps are perpendicular to the central fold in your hand, creating "wings". 
10. (Optional) Remove the tip of the plane's nose by cutting .5 cm from the tip or by folding .5 cm of the nose back into the interior of the plane so that the central crease lies on itself on either side of the fold. This will help the plane fly farther.
